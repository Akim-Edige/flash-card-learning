Flash card learning project. Using simple GUI implemented with tkinter.

- Using pandas library it reads csv files with learning words and learned. 

- It takes randomly word from learning words and if it is not in the learned words
then shows it in the GUI. 

- It shows front of the card with the word and after 3 seconds back of the card 
with the meaning.

- If user clicks red button then it will show next word.

- If user clicks green button then it will add this word into "learned" words and will
not show this word again.
